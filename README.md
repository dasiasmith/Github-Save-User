  ## Description

  The link to the deployed site can be found [Here](https://dasiasmith.github.io/Github-Save-User/)

  An application that utilizes React with TypeScript and Firestore that allows users to search GitHub username. If a username exists it will fill in table rows with the user's profile link, name, number of public repos, number of public gists, following, followers, and date created. 
  For this application, style-wise I wanted it to match the simple GitHub black and what theme. ESLint was also used to filters any errors and make the code readable. The majority of the code can be found in the SearchBar component. I found since the code was relatively short it was less redundant than creating multiple components and useState functions when it could all be done at once. 
  The application is deployed using GitHub pages, again to keep everything in a central location. This also give me the ability to push and edit the page once.
